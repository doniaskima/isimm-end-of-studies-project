\subsection{Dynamic Equipment Design}
To effectively transition from a static to a dynamic equipment list, we need to carefully design the system architecture. The following sections provide a detailed overview of the class structure and interactions.
\subsubsection{Dynamic Equipment List issues}
The Dynamic Equipment List feature was previously implemented as a static list. This static list required manual updates and did not reflect real-time changes to the equipment database. The key characteristics of the static implementation included:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Manual updates to the equipment list.
    \item Limited flexibility and responsiveness to changes.
    \item High maintenance overhead due to frequent updates.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Issues with Static Implementation}
The static implementation had several drawbacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} As the number of equipment items grew, maintaining the static list became increasingly cumbersome.
    \item \textbf{Real-time Updates:} Any changes to the equipment database were not immediately reflected in the list, leading to potential inconsistencies.
    \item \textbf{User Experience:} Users could not rely on the list for up-to-date information, which impacted their ability to make informed decisions.
\end{itemize}

As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:static_equipment_list}, subcontractors were limited to only checking the checkboxes for the available equipment.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{src/assets/chapters/StaticDynamicEquipementList.png}
    \caption{Previous Static Equipment List}
    \label{fig:static_equipment_list}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Dynamic Equipment List}
To address these issues, we are transitioning to a dynamic equipment list. The dynamic implementation will automatically update the list based on changes in the equipment database, ensuring real-time accuracy and reducing maintenance overhead. Key features of the dynamic implementation include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Real-time Updates:} The list will automatically reflect changes made to the equipment database.
    \item \textbf{Improved Scalability:} The system can handle an increased number of equipment items without additional maintenance.
    \item \textbf{Enhanced User Experience:} Users will have access to up-to-date information, improving their ability to make decisions.
    \item \textbf{Reduced Maintenance:} Eliminates the need for manual updates, reducing the time and effort required to maintain the list.
    \item \textbf{Request System:} Subcontractors can request new equipment items directly through the system, allowing admins to approve, reject, and assign these items to appropriate groups.
\end{itemize}

The planned dynamic equipment list will also include comprehensive admin and subcompany views. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_equipment_list_admin}, admins will have the capability to create groups, assign equipment, move equipment, and approve or reject equipment requests. Subcontractors, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_equipment_list_subcompany}, will be able to write and request new equipment items, ensuring they have the necessary tools for their projects.

\subsubsection{Dynamic Equipment Design}
To effectively transition from a static to a dynamic equipment list, we need to carefully design the system architecture. The dynamic system will facilitate real-time updates, scalability, and a user-friendly experience. The following sections provide a detailed overview of the class structure and interactions essential for implementing this dynamic equipment list.

The dynamic equipment list system will consist of several key components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Equipment Class:} This class will represent individual equipment items, including attributes such as name, group, status (requested, approved, rejected), and other relevant details.
    \item \textbf{Group Class:} This class will manage groups of equipment, allowing the creation, duplication, and deletion of groups. It will also handle the assignment and movement of equipment items between groups.
    \item \textbf{Request Class:} This class will handle equipment requests submitted by subcontractors. It will track the status of requests (pending, approved, rejected) and include details such as the equipment name and requested group.
    \item \textbf{User Class:} This class will manage user information, differentiating between admin and subcontractor roles, and providing appropriate permissions and functionalities for each role.
    \item \textbf{Notification System:} This component will handle real-time and email notifications to keep users informed about important actions like equipment requests, approvals, and rejections.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adjust Feedback Notification}



\subsection{Overhaul of the Role System}
Before the Sprint 1 overhaul, the Aermax platform's role system was less delineated, with certain roles having either too broad or too narrow a range of permissions. This occasionally led to confusion, inefficiencies, and security concerns. For instance, Team Leaders had the same project creation rights as Administrators, and Workers had visibility into project overviews that were not relevant to their tasks.

After the Sprint 1 overhaul, we introduced a more refined role system, ensuring that permissions are tightly aligned with the responsibilities intrinsic to each role. The system was restructured to provide a balance between usability and security, reducing the cognitive load on users by limiting their interfaces to the features and information they need for their specific roles.

\textbf{Scenario Demonstrations After Overhaul:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Administrator Scenario:} An Administrator maintains complete control, capable of managing all aspects of the project lifecycle.
    \item \textbf{Employee Scenario:} Employees continue to have similar administrative rights, including full packet visibility and project management capabilities.
    \item \textbf{Project Manager Scenario:} Project Managers are now provided with tailored access, capable of managing specific project packets and workflows.
    \item \textbf{Worker Scenario:} Workers are limited to their own packets, focusing their dashboard on personal tasks without additional project creation or overview privileges.
    \item \textbf{Team Leader Scenario:} Team Leaders have targeted oversight, managing only the packets within their project phase, without the distraction of other project overviews or creation capabilities.
\end{itemize}

This targeted approach in the role system refines the user experience on the Aermax platform, ensuring each role has the access needed to perform effectively, securely, and efficiently.

\subsection{Enhance Working Packets UI \& UX}
In our continuous efforts to elevate the user experience on the Aermax platform, a significant upgrade was made to the Working Packets UI \& UX, particularly focusing on the administrative interface.

    \caption{Authentication Flow Using Keycloak: A visual guide to the user authentication process with Keycloak.}
    \label{fig:authentication_flow_keycloak}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:authentication_flow_keycloak} illustrates the authentication flow using Keycloak. The figure will show the step-by-step authentication flow, demonstrating how users interact with Keycloak during the login process. It provides a visual explanation of the authentication steps from the user initiating a login request to receiving a token from Keycloak.

As part of this overhaul, we encountered the challenge of duplicate user entries due to previous system design limitations. By leveraging Keycloak’s versatile user federation and identity provider features, we were able to consolidate user accounts and eliminate redundancies, thereby solving the issue of duplicate entries. 

Keycloakify complemented this integration by allowing us to customize the authentication pages to align with our platform's aesthetics and usability standards.
