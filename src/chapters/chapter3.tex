    \subsection{Dynamic Equipment List}
    \subsubsection{Previous Implementation}
    The Dynamic Equipment List feature was previously implemented as a static list. This static list required manual updates and did not reflect real-time changes to the equipment database. The key characteristics of the static implementation included:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Manual updates to the equipment list.
        \item Limited flexibility and responsiveness to changes.
        \item High maintenance overhead due to frequent updates.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsubsection{Issues with Static Implementation}
    The static implementation had several drawbacks:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Scalability:} As the number of equipment items grew, maintaining the static list became increasingly cumbersome.
        \item \textbf{Real-time Updates:} Any changes to the equipment database were not immediately reflected in the list, leading to potential inconsistencies.
        \item \textbf{User Experience:} Users could not rely on the list for up-to-date information, which impacted their ability to make informed decisions.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{figure}[H]

        \caption{Previous Static Equipment List}
        \label{fig:static_equipment_list}
    \end{figure}
    
    \subsubsection{Planned Dynamic Implementation}
    To address these issues, we are transitioning to a dynamic equipment list. The dynamic implementation will automatically update the list based on changes in the equipment database, ensuring real-time accuracy and reducing maintenance overhead. Key features of the dynamic implementation include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Real-time Updates:} The list will automatically reflect changes made to the equipment database.
        \item \textbf{Improved Scalability:} The system can handle an increased number of equipment items without additional maintenance.
        \item \textbf{Enhanced User Experience:} Users will have access to up-to-date information, improving their ability to make decisions.
        \item \textbf{Reduced Maintenance:} Eliminates the need for manual updates, reducing the time and effort required to maintain the list.
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Overhaul of the Project Status}

The Aermax platform has undergone a strategic overhaul of the project status functionality to streamline project lifecycle management and improve visibility for all stakeholders. This enhancement was designed to introduce a more dynamic, intuitive, and color-coded status system that aligns with the operational needs and facilitates better decision-making processes.

\subsubsection{Before the Overhaul:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The status indicators were limited, lacking the granularity required for nuanced project management.
    \item There was no clear distinction between the various stages of a project, from contemplation to completion.
    \item Subcontractors had limited visibility, which sometimes led to inefficiencies and a lack of coordination.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{After the Overhaul:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We've implemented a comprehensive status system, which includes new states such as 'In Progress', 'Closed', 'Re-activated', and 'Cancelled', each represented by distinct color codes.
    \item The status 'In Progress' (green) is particularly significant as it is the only type of project visible to subcontractors, ensuring they have access to relevant, actionable projects.
    \item 'Closed/Finished' projects are denoted with a dark blue color, signifying completion, while 'Re-activated' projects can revert from 'Closed' status when a customer requires additional work or services.
    \item Projects that are no longer active are labeled as 'Cancelled' and are represented in red, providing immediate visual cues for the current state of a project.
    \item A migration process has been instituted to update all existing projects to conform to the new status system, which includes modifying the projectStatus enum to the updated states.
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection*{Technical Enhancements:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The AggregatedPhase class now includes an attribute that reflects the phase status based on the progress of the included working packets.
    \item The rules for phase status determination are as follows:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 'Open' by default or when all included packets are open.
            \item 'Completed' if all packets within the phase are completed.
            \item 'Cancelled' if all packets are canceled.
            \item 'In Progress' if there is any packet currently active.
        \end{itemize}
    \item The calendar interface has been upgraded to hide/show project phases and working packets based on their completion or cancellation status, allowing for a cleaner and more focused view.
    \item Events in the calendar have been color-coded to correlate with the status of the project phase or working packet, enhancing the visual experience and making it easier for users to digest the project's progress at a glance.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Visual Enhancement:}
This figure illustrates the enhanced project filter interface, showcasing intuitive filtering options for project number, project status, and state, complete with color-coded status indicators.

\end{figure}



\subsection{Overhaul of the Role System}
Before the Sprint 1 overhaul, the Aermax platform's role system was less delineated, with certain roles having either too broad or too narrow a range of permissions. This occasionally led to confusion, inefficiencies, and security concerns. For instance, Team Leaders had the same project creation rights as Administrators, and Workers had visibility into project overviews that were not relevant to their tasks.

After the Sprint 1 overhaul, we introduced a more refined role system, ensuring that permissions are tightly aligned with the responsibilities intrinsic to each role. The system was restructured to provide a balance between usability and security, reducing the cognitive load on users by limiting their interfaces to the features and information they need for their specific roles.

\subsubsection{Detailed Role Permissions Before \& After}

\textbf{Scenario Demonstrations After Overhaul:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Administrator Scenario:} An Administrator maintains complete control, capable of managing all aspects of the project lifecycle.
    \item \textbf{Employee Scenario:} Employees continue to have similar administrative rights, including full packet visibility and project management capabilities.
    \item \textbf{Project Manager Scenario:} Project Managers are now provided with tailored access, capable of managing specific project packets and workflows.
    \item \textbf{Worker Scenario:} Workers are limited to their own packets, focusing their dashboard on personal tasks without additional project creation or overview privileges.
    \item \textbf{Team Leader Scenario:} Team Leaders have targeted oversight, managing only the packets within their project phase, without the distraction of other project overviews or creation capabilities.
\end{itemize}

This targeted approach in the role system refines the user experience on the Aermax platform, ensuring each role has the access needed to perform effectively, securely, and efficiently.

\subsection{Enhance Working Packets UI \& UX}

    \label{fig:authentication_flow_keycloak}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:authentication_flow_keycloak} illustrates the authentication flow using Keycloak. The figure will show the step-by-step authentication flow, demonstrating how users interact with Keycloak during the login process. It provides a visual explanation of the authentication steps from the user initiating a login request to receiving a token from Keycloak.

As part of this overhaul, we encountered the challenge of duplicate user entries due to previous system design limitations. By leveraging Keycloak’s versatile user federation and identity provider features, we were able to consolidate user accounts and eliminate redundancies, thereby solving the issue of duplicate entries. 

Keycloakify complemented this integration by allowing us to customize the authentication pages to align with our platform's aesthetics and usability standards.
