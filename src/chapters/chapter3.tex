\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, we are going to analyze the various specifications and requirements of the whole project from development to production.
We will also describe the product's main features and the conception that should be met for the end result.

\section{Functional requirements}
Since our project is fairly voluminous, we identify what we consider the necessities for our app as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Doing something practical.
    \item Doing another thing.
    \item Creating some items.
    \item Creating individual docker files for all microservices based on what they require.
\end{itemize}

Here is an example of the textual description of one of the use cases scenarios:

\section{Conception}
In this section, we will dive deep into the conception and the logic behind the parts of the application:

% --------------- Non functional Requirements --------------- %
\section{Non-functional requirements}
Non functional requirements describe any specification that does not add direct business value but is nonetheless crucial for the good operation of a developed software.
For our app, what we should focus on is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reliability and Availability:} The software should be available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.
    \item \textbf{Security:} Clients should be able to safely login to the dashboard with a strong authentication system.
    \item \textbf{Maintainability and Recoverability:} We should respond to LinkedIn changes all the time as fast as possible.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} This is the main reason we're migrating to a new architecture in the first place.
    \item \textbf{Documentation:} We should always document each and every step we make extensively so that new developers can onboard on the project in a fast and efficient way, which further emphasizes reliability.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we discussed our main objectives that we should meet during the course of our internship.
We also discuss the various layers and services of the application.
In what follows, we will discuss the realization part with heavy focus on DevOps and the actual implementation of the new architecture.
