\chapter{Elevating Aermax – First Sprint Enhancements and Integrations}

\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, we cover the first sprint of the Aermax project, focusing on team collaboration and meetings, as well as the key enhancements and features we implemented to improve the platform.

\section{Team Collaboration and Meetings}

\subsection{Daily Standups}
\textbf{Purpose:} Share daily progress, plan the day, and address blockers. \\
\textbf{Structure:} Each team member provides a brief update on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What they did yesterday.
    \item What they plan to do today.
    \item Any blockers they are facing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Retrospectives}
\textbf{Purpose:} Discuss what went well, what didn’t, and identify areas for improvement. \\
\textbf{Outcome:} Action items to enhance future sprints.

\subsection{Client Meetings}
\textbf{Initial Requirements Gathering:} Detailed discussions to understand client needs. \\

    \subsection{Dynamic Equipment List}
    \subsubsection{Previous Implementation}
    The Dynamic Equipment List feature was previously implemented as a static list. This static list required manual updates and did not reflect real-time changes to the equipment database. The key characteristics of the static implementation included:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Manual updates to the equipment list.
        \item Limited flexibility and responsiveness to changes.
        \item High maintenance overhead due to frequent updates.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \subsubsection{Issues with Static Implementation}
    The static implementation had several drawbacks:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Scalability:} As the number of equipment items grew, maintaining the static list became increasingly cumbersome.
        \item \textbf{Real-time Updates:} Any changes to the equipment database were not immediately reflected in the list, leading to potential inconsistencies.
        \item \textbf{User Experience:} Users could not rely on the list for up-to-date information, which impacted their ability to make informed decisions.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{figure}[H]

        \caption{Previous Static Equipment List}
        \label{fig:static_equipment_list}
    \end{figure}
    
    \subsubsection{Planned Dynamic Implementation}
    To address these issues, we are transitioning to a dynamic equipment list. The dynamic implementation will automatically update the list based on changes in the equipment database, ensuring real-time accuracy and reducing maintenance overhead. Key features of the dynamic implementation include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Real-time Updates:} The list will automatically reflect changes made to the equipment database.
        \item \textbf{Improved Scalability:} The system can handle an increased number of equipment items without additional maintenance.
        \item \textbf{Enhanced User Experience:} Users will have access to up-to-date information, improving their ability to make decisions.
        \item \textbf{Reduced Maintenance:} Eliminates the need for manual updates, reducing the time and effort required to maintain the list.
    \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Conception of New Feature}
To effectively transition from a static to a dynamic equipment list, we need to carefully design the system architecture. The following sections provide a detailed overview of the class structure and interactions.
