\subsection{About Aermax}
The company Aermax, located in Stuttgart, Germany, specializes in industrial alpinism. They offer professional services for high-altitude or deep-location work using industrial alpinism techniques. An industrial alpine climber is a specialist trained to work at great heights or depths. During operations, these specialists use a methodology known as the rope access technique.This technique allows them to execute their work in challenging locations without the need for scaffolding or lifts. The work I am currently doing is for the \textbf{client Aermax}.\\
Aermax's services include the capacity to work at any height or depth, using ropes for a flexible way of deployment. This method enables the execution of work without the need for scaffolding and lifts, making it cost-effective and efficient. Additionally, their operations do not interrupt business or production processes and require less preparation time. Aermax also has the capability for short-notice emergency deployment.\\
With these advantages, Aermax ensures that their services are effective, adaptive, and flexible with any surrounding environment, which is quite challenging, while maintaining a higher level of safety and efficiency.
\section{Competitor Benchmarking}
This section will discuss the analysis of the Aermax platform: review of the features, capabilities, and performance. The goal is to see the strong and weak sides of this service and compare it to industry standards. This analysis can act as a guideline on how to improve our platform to effectively manage high-altitude projects.

\section{Assessment of the case}
This chapter shall evaluate the current state of the project, its strengths and weaknesses, propose solutions for its issues, and outline its implementation steps. The systematic approach is aimed at enhancing the performance of the project and user satisfaction.

\subsection{Describing the work procedure}
The work on any project, first of all, needs to be preceded by the profound study of the existing ones, undermining the strengths and weaknesses of the current system, and business decisions which should be taken into account during the conception and realization.
\subsection{Criticizing the current state}
After studying the existing, we can determine its limitations:
\subsubsection{Functional Issues}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Functionalities are not working as expected.
    \item New features are yet to be developed.
    \item Parts of the application need complete overhauling to meet the client's requirements.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Technical Issues}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Since cron jobs are running for the whole day, bugs are hard to respond to fast enough because we can only deploy once at the end of the day.
    \item Many bugs remain unfixed.
    \item The code needs refactoring due to some bad practices that make the app take more time to execute.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proposed solution}
With the problems identified, we make the following proposals for the way forward.

\begin{itemize}
    \item First, existing features will be enhanced to ensure that they work as they should. This will entail a keen review and subsequent test of the features to identify and fix any bugs.
    \item In addition, new features will be developed based on priority to ensure that the application meets all of the client's requirements.
    \item There will also be thorough refactoring of the codebase to remove bad practices and optimize performance.
    \item The UI/UX is also recommended to be enhanced for a better user experience. The proposed solutions should be aimed at greatly enhancing the general performance of the application, reliability, and user satisfaction.
    \item Build a new feature: Reward System to make Aermax's users more engaged and motivated.
\end{itemize}

The following figure (Figure \ref{fig:Reward_System_explain_image}) provides an overall view of the proposed Reward System for Aermax. This system is designed to transform the user experience by making tasks more engaging and rewarding.

\end{figure}
   
% ----------------------- Development Methodology ----------------------- %
\section{Development Methodology}
The development methodology adopted for this project is aimed at ensuring flexibility, efficiency, and responsiveness to changes. This approach is particularly suitable for dynamic environments where requirements can evolve over time, and continuous improvement is crucial.

\subsection{Agile methodology}
Agile is a structured and iterative approach to project management and product development.
It recognizes the volatility of product development, and provides a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change without going off the rails.

\subsection{Scrum methodology}
The Scrum team commits to the completion of an increment of work, which is potentially shippable, through set periods of time called sprints. They strive to build a learning loop in order to quickly collect and integrate customer feedback. Scrum teams embrace specific roles, create special artifacts, and hold regular ceremonies to keep things moving. The following figure (Figure \ref{fig:Scrum_Framework_image}) illustrates the Scrum framework, showcasing the key components and processes involved.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{src/assets/chapters/blog-scrum-process-opt.jpg}
    \caption{The Scrum Framework}
    \label{fig:Scrum_Framework_image}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Kanban methodology}
Kanban is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency (or flow).
Kanban teams focus on reducing the time a project takes from start by using a Kanban board to continuously improve their flow of work.
To explain more in details, Kanban is based on a continuous workflow structure that keeps teams nimble and ready to adapt to changing priorities.
Work items —represented by cards— are organized on the board where they flow from one stage of the workflow or column to the next.
Common workflow stages are To Do, In Progress, In Review, and Done.

\subsection{Scrumban methodology}
ScrumBan is a hybrid Agile methodology that combines elements of Scrum and Kanban. Here are some important points about Scrumban:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hybrid Methodology: ScrumBan merges the flexibility of Kanban with the structure of Scrum to optimize workflow.
    \item Continuous Improvement: Similar to Kanban, Scrumban focuses on continuous improvement with the visualization of workflow and by limiting Work in Progress (WIP).
    \item Iterative Approach: Scrumban retains the iterative approach of Scrum—allowing periodic review and adaptation of processes.
    \item Adaptive Planning: A team can plan in a way that it can change the priorities and resources, if so required, as per the changing requirements while using Scrumban.
    \item Lean Principles: Scrumban adopts the principles of Lean—like waste elimination and maximization of value delivery—to streamline processes.
\end{itemize}
The following figure (Figure \ref{fig:Scrumban_image}) shows the Scrumban board, illustrating how this hybrid methodology combines the best practices of Scrum and Kanban to optimize workflow and enhance productivity
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{src/assets/chapters/Scrumban.png}
    \caption{The Scrumban board}
    \label{fig:Scrumban_image}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Choice of development methodology}
Scrumban has been chosen as the preferred development methodology for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Flexibility:} ScrumBan is a very flexible approach that brings some structure to Scrum while maintaining a high level of adaptability, similar to Kanban, which includes fast responses to changing priorities while maintaining a framing order for work.
    \item \textbf{Continuous Improvement:} Scrumban encourages continuous improvement, and teams can evolve their process over time.
    \item \textbf{Reduced Waste:} Scrumban introduces the principle of just-in-time delivery of user stories and WIP limits to ensure minimization of wastes.
    \item \textbf{Improved Visibility:} Visual boards improve the visibility of work, enabling transparency and encouraging collaboration.
    \item \textbf{Optimized Flow:} Scrumban is a way of optimizing flow by balancing Kanban flexibility with structured Scrum, enabling teams to build value consistently and predictably.
\end{itemize}
The following figure (Figure \ref{fig:armax-board}) shows the Aermax Board, illustrating how Scrumban is implemented to manage tasks and workflow effectively within the team.
