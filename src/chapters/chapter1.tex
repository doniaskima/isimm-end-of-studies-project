% ----------------------- Assessment of the case ----------------------- %
\section{Assessment of the case}
\subsection{Describing the work procedure}
The work on any project must first of all be preceded by a thorough study of the existing ones which undermines the strengths and weaknesses of the current system, as well as the business decisions that should be taken into account during the conception as well as the realization.

\subsection{Criticizing the current state}
After studying the existing, we can determine its limitations:

\subsubsection{Functional Issues}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Functionalities are not working as expected.
    \item New features are still not developed.
    \item Parts of the application need complete changes to satisfy the client's requirements.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Technical Issues}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Since cron jobs are running for the whole day, bugs are hard to respond to fast enough because we can only deploy once at the end of the day.
    \item Many bugs remain unfixed.
    \item The code needs refactoring due to some bad practices that make the app take more time to execute.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Proposed solution}
To address the identified issues, we propose the following solutions. First, we will focus on enhancing existing features to ensure they work as expected. This includes a thorough review and testing of the functionalities to identify and fix any bugs. Additionally, we will prioritize the development of new features to meet the client's requirements. Comprehensive refactoring of the codebase will be undertaken to eliminate bad practices and improve performance. We also suggest improving the UI/UX design to enhance user experience and satisfaction. By implementing these solutions, we aim to significantly improve the application's overall performance, reliability, and user satisfaction.

\subsection{Work to Be Done}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop the major feature: the reward system.
    \item  Deploy the reward system into staging and then production.
    \item Enhance existing features to ensure they work as expected.
    \item Conduct a thorough review and testing of functionalities to identify and fix any bugs.
    \item Develop new features to meet the client's requirements.
    \item Refactor the codebase to eliminate bad practices and improve performance.
    \item Improve the UI/UX design to enhance user experience and satisfaction.
\end{itemize}

% ----------------------- Development Methodology ----------------------- %
\section{Development Methodology}
\subsection{Agile methodology}
Agile is a structured and iterative approach to project management and product development.
It recognizes the volatility of product development, and provides a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change without going off the rails.

\subsection{Scrum methodology}
Scrum teams commit to completing an increment of work, which is potentially shippable, through set intervals called sprints.
Their goal is to create learning loops to quickly gather and integrate customer feedback.
Scrum teams adopt specific roles, create special artifacts, and hold regular ceremonies to keep things moving forward.


\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{src/assets/chapters/blog-scrum-process-opt.jpg}
    \caption{The Scrum Framework}
    \label{fig:Scrum_Framework_image}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Kanban methodology}
Kanban is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency (or flow).
Kanban teams focus on reducing the time a project takes from start by using a Kanban board to continuously improve their flow of work.
To explain more in details, Kanban is based on a continuous workflow structure that keeps teams nimble and ready to adapt to changing priorities.
Work items —represented by cards— are organized on the board where they flow from one stage of the workflow or column to the next.
Common workflow stages are To Do, In Progress, In Review, and Done.

\subsection{Scrumban methodology}
Scrumban is a hybrid Agile methodology that combines elements of Scrum and Kanban. Here are key points about Scrumban:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Hybrid Methodology: Scrumban blends the flexibility of Kanban with the structure of Scrum to optimize workflow.
    \item Continuous Improvement: Like Kanban, Scrumban emphasizes continuous improvement through visualizing workflow and limiting Work in Progress (WIP).
    \item Iterative Approach: Scrumban maintains Scrum's iterative approach, allowing for regular review and adaptation of processes.
    \item Adaptive Planning: Scrumban enables adaptive planning, allowing teams to adjust priorities and resources based on changing requirements.
    \item Lean Principles: Scrumban incorporates Lean principles, such as eliminating waste and maximizing value delivery, to streamline processes.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{src/assets/chapters/Scrumban.png}
    \caption{The Scrumban board}
    \label{fig:Scrumban_image}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The choice for AERMAX}
Scrumban has been chosen as the preferred development methodology for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Flexibility:} Flexibility is a key characteristic of Scrumban, as it combines the structure of Scrum with the adaptability of Kanban. This allows teams to respond quickly to changes in priorities or requirements, while still having a framework to guide their work.
    \item \textbf{Continuous Improvement:} Continuous improvement is strongly encouraged in Scrumban, as teams are allowed to evolve their processes over time. Regular reflection and adjustment promote more efficient workflows, leading to a more productive development process.
    \item \textbf{Reduced Waste:} Scrumban helps reduce waste in the development process by emphasizing just-in-time delivery and limiting work in progress. Teams focus on completing tasks before starting new ones, which leads to a smoother flow and faster delivery.
    \item \textbf{Improved Visibility:} With Scrumban's visual boards, teams have improved visibility into their work. Everyone can see what tasks are in progress, what's completed, and what's next, fostering transparency and collaboration.
    \item \textbf{Optimized Flow:} Scrumban optimizes flow by balancing the flexibility of Kanban with the structured approach of Scrum. This enables teams to deliver value more consistently and predictably, leading to happier customers and stakeholders.
\end{itemize}

    \label{fig:armax-board}
\end{figure}
 
\subsection{Unified Modeling Language}
The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system. In our case, we used UML to design the top level view of the systems therefore we only used the Use Case and Sequence diagrams.

\section{General Team Structure}
The Aermax project team is composed of diverse and skilled professionals, each bringing unique expertise to the project. Below is the general team structure:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Anis Benna} is the lead developer, responsible for overseeing the development process and ensuring the technical direction aligns with the project's goals.
    \item \textbf{Robert Könitz} acts as a mentor and sparring partner, providing guidance, support, and valuable insights to the development team.
    \item \textbf{Joachim Liedtke} an experienced developer, contributing significantly to the project's advancement with his extensive knowledge and skills.
