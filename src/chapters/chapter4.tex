\section{Introduction}
Throughout this chapter, we will delve into the planning, design considerations, and implementation of our reward system, from conception and development to deployment.
\section{Sprints Backlog}
During the Sprint Planning meeting, the effort for each task in the first and second sprint backlogs was assessed based on the total working hours required. The prioritization of these backlog items is depicted through their sequence in the table, with items placed at the top representing higher urgency. Additionally, the accompanying image showcases the board that serves as our operational platform at Incedo.

\section{Initial Planning and Conceptualization Phase}

\subsection{Overview}
This phase initiates the development of a reward system, aimed at closely aligning with customer needs through a structured approach. It sets the groundwork for translating these needs into a functional design, ensuring the system not only meets but anticipates user requirements. Our focus here is on establishing a clear vision and framework that will guide the entire development process, from conceptualization to implementation, fostering a user-centric and impactful solution.

\subsection*{System Goals and Objectives}
The primary goal of the reward system is to enhance user engagement and motivation within our software ecosystem. Specifically, the system aims to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Increase User Engagement:} Encourage active participation and interaction with the software by providing incentives and rewards for desired behaviours.
    \item \textbf{Drive User Motivation:} Motivate users to achieve specific goals, complete tasks, and contribute positively to the community through a structured rewards program.
    \item \textbf{Enhance User Experience:} Improve overall satisfaction and enjoyment of the software by offering tangible rewards, recognition, and opportunities for progression.
    \item \textbf{Foster Community Growth:} Facilitate the growth and development of a vibrant user community by fostering collaboration, competition, and a sense of belonging through the reward system.
\end{itemize}
These objectives align with our overarching mission to create a dynamic and engaging software platform that not only meets but exceeds user expectations, ultimately leading to increased user retention and loyalty.

\subsection{High-Level System Overview}
This section offers a conceptual snapshot of our reward system, outlining its key components and their anticipated interactions. Below, we delve into the global use cases, illustrating the system's functionality in greater detail.
In this section, we present the Initial System Architecture Sketch, which offers a visual representation of the foundational structure of our reward system. This diagram serves as a high-level blueprint, illustrating the primary components and their interactions within the system. It is designed to clarify the modular approach we have adopted, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and robustness.

The architecture is segmented into distinct modules, each responsible for a core aspect of the system's functionality:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Token and XP Ledger:} Manages the currency of motivation - tokens and experience points.
    \item \textbf{Achievements Management:} Tracks and administers user accomplishments.
    \item \textbf{User Authentication:} Secures the system, ensuring that users can safely access their data and functionalities.
\end{itemize}

As we progress through the stages of development, this sketch may evolve to incorporate feedback and additional features, ultimately guiding us towards a fully-realized implementation that aligns with our vision of a dynamic and engaging user experience.

    \label{fig:reward_system_architecture_overview}
\end{figure}

\section{Design}
This phase of the project builds upon our foundational work to refine and expand the architecture of our reward system. We delve into key considerations, decisions, and enhancements introduced in this release, focusing particularly on how our models support the reward functionalities.

\subsection{Static Modeling}
The static modeling phase has been pivotal in defining the core structure of our reward system. We have continued to refine our data models and database schema to align with our evolving functional requirements and business rules.

\subsubsection{Domain Model}
We have structured our reward system around three primary classes: RewardLog, UserRewards, and Achievement. These classes are designed to seamlessly interact within our system to facilitate efficient reward management and user engagement through achievements.



\subsection{Classes Description}
\begin{table}[H]
    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5} % Padding
    \centering
    \medskip
    \begin{tabularx}{1\textwidth} {
            | >{\hsize=0.4\hsize\linewidth=\hsize\raggedright\arraybackslash}X
            | >{\hsize=1.6\hsize\linewidth=\hsize\raggedright\arraybackslash}X |}
        \hline
        \rowcolor{primary} \textbf{Class Name} & \textbf{Description} \\
        \hline
        RewardLog & Models individual reward transactions, capturing details like user ID, reward type (XP, token), and the source of the reward (e.g., completing a task or manual adjustment). \\
        \hline
        UserRewards & Models the cumulative rewards and achievements for a user, providing a comprehensive overview of their progress and tokens. \\
        \hline
        Achievement & Details the achievements that users can earn, including the criteria for earning them and the rewards associated with them. \\
        \hline
        Rank & Represents the various ranks users can achieve. Each rank includes a label (e.g., 'Ground Floor'), the levels required to reach the rank, and a description that highlights the significance of the rank. This class helps track user progression and assigns appropriate ranks based on their XP levels. \\
        \hline
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}



For these classes, we have defined the following associations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each UserRewards document embeds an array of Achievement subdocuments, reflecting the user's progress towards various achievements.
    \item RewardLog entries are linked to specific actions or events, such as achievement completions, which can update the UserRewards document.
\end{itemize}
 we illustrate the extension of our class diagram, highlighting newly added classes and associations for clarity.

\subsubsection{Data Dictionary}
In table IV.4, we provide a comprehensive overview of the key data elements used in our model, detailing how they interact and are structured within our database. This dictionary will cover the essential attributes for each class, such as userId, type, and source in RewardLog, and how they are indexed for performance and uniqueness.

\subsubsection{Logical Data Model}
Building on the foundation laid by the first version of our logical data model, our MVP, we now present an updated model that retains the original structure while introducing necessary expansions for this release. This updated model provides insights into the relationships and structure of our data entities, reflecting the full scope of the initial solution. Figure IV.2 illustrates the class diagram, showing how new and existing entities are interconnected within our system.

\section{Software Architecture}
Following the design phase, we chose to implement a separate microservice built with NestJS to enhance the scalability and maintainability of our reward system. This microservice architecture allows for isolated development and deployment, which simplifies updates and scaling operations.

\subsection{Microservice Architecture}
The new microservice integrates seamlessly with existing services such as the operation-service and user-service. It communicates via RabbitMQ, a robust message broker that ensures reliable and efficient message handling between services. This approach not only improves the system's responsiveness but also its overall resilience, allowing each component to operate independently yet cohesively.

\paragraph{Benefits of NestJS and RabbitMQ:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NestJS:} Provides a scalable framework for building efficient and fail-safe systems, thanks to its use of modern JavaScript features and its integration with TypeScript.
    \item \textbf{RabbitMQ:} Facilitates secure and flexible cross-service communication, enhances fault tolerance, and manages load effectively, even under high demand.
\end{itemize}

This architectural decision supports our goal of creating a dynamic, reliable, and scalable reward system, prepared to handle increasing loads and complexity as the Aermax platform grows.

\section{Technology Stack and Framework Selection}

\subsection*{Why We Chose RabbitMQ}
The decision to choose RabbitMQ as our message broker was based on specific needs for our system's communication and architecture:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Decoupling of Services:} RabbitMQ provides independence between services, facilitating a more maintainable and flexible architecture.
    \item \textbf{Asynchronous Communication:} It enables services to communicate without synchronous waits, increasing efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} RabbitMQ supports even message distribution, which is essential for scaling services effectively.
    \item \textbf{Reliability and Fault Tolerance:} It ensures message delivery reliability, even when some services are down.
    \item \textbf{Centralized Management:} RabbitMQ offers centralized management of message flows, improving monitoring and control.
    \item \textbf{Ordering and Prioritization:} It manages the order and priority of message handling, which is crucial for process sequencing.
\end{itemize}

\section{Message Broker Operation}

\subsection*{How Does a Message Broker Work?}
A message broker like RabbitMQ plays a critical role in modern software architectures by managing communications between different parts of a system. It acts as a middleman that allows services to send and receive messages without knowing the complexities of each other’s design, location, or technology.

\paragraph*{Example: PDF Creation Process}
Consider a PDF creation process in a web application, which is a typical use case for a message broker. Here’s how it operates:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A user initiates a PDF creation request from the website application interface.
    \item The application, acting as the \textbf{Producer}, publishes a message to the RabbitMQ \textbf{Exchange}. This message contains the user’s information and the request details.
    \item RabbitMQ routes the message to the appropriate \textbf{Queue} based on the message's content and the queue's binding rules.
    \item The \textbf{Consumer}, which could be a PDF Creator Worker, listens to the queue, consumes the message, and processes the PDF creation.
\end{enumerate}

This process showcases how RabbitMQ facilitates asynchronous communication, ensuring the application’s responsiveness and reliability. The Producer is decoupled from the Consumer, allowing for independent scaling and maintenance.
