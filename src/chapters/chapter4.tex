    \label{fig:reward_system_architecture_overview}
\end{figure}

\section{Design}
This phase of the project builds upon our foundational work to refine and expand the architecture of our reward system. We delve into key considerations, decisions, and enhancements introduced in this release, focusing particularly on how our models support the reward functionalities.

\subsection{Static Modeling}
The static modeling phase has been pivotal in defining the core structure of our reward system. We have continued to refine our data models and database schema to align with our evolving functional requirements and business rules.

\subsubsection{Domain Model}
We have structured our reward system around three primary classes: RewardLog, UserRewards, and Achievement. These classes are designed to seamlessly interact within our system to facilitate efficient reward management and user engagement through achievements.

\subsection{Classes Description}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{10cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Class Name} & \textbf{Description} \\
\hline
RewardLog & Models individual reward transactions, capturing details like user ID, reward type (XP, token), and the source of the reward (e.g., completing a task or manual adjustment). \\
\hline
UserRewards & Models the cumulative rewards and achievements for a user, providing a comprehensive overview of their progress and tokens. \\
\hline
Achievement & Details the achievements that users can earn, including the criteria for earning them and the rewards associated with them. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

For these classes, we have defined the following associations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each UserRewards document embeds an array of Achievement subdocuments, reflecting the user's progress towards various achievements.
    \item RewardLog entries are linked to specific actions or events, such as achievement completions, which can update the UserRewards document.
\end{itemize}
 we illustrate the extension of our class diagram, highlighting newly added classes and associations for clarity.

\subsubsection{Data Dictionary}
In table IV.4, we provide a comprehensive overview of the key data elements used in our model, detailing how they interact and are structured within our database. This dictionary will cover the essential attributes for each class, such as userId, type, and source in RewardLog, and how they are indexed for performance and uniqueness.

\subsubsection{Logical Data Model}
Building on the foundation laid by the first version of our logical data model, our MVP, we now present an updated model that retains the original structure while introducing necessary expansions for this release. This updated model provides insights into the relationships and structure of our data entities, reflecting the full scope of the initial solution. Figure IV.2 illustrates the class diagram, showing how new and existing entities are interconnected within our system.

\section{Software Architecture}
Following the design phase, we chose to implement a separate microservice built with NestJS to enhance the scalability and maintainability of our reward system. This microservice architecture allows for isolated development and deployment, which simplifies updates and scaling operations.

\subsection{Microservice Architecture}
The new microservice integrates seamlessly with existing services such as the operation-service and user-service. It communicates via RabbitMQ, a robust message broker that ensures reliable and efficient message handling between services. This approach not only improves the system's responsiveness but also its overall resilience, allowing each component to operate independently yet cohesively.

\paragraph{Benefits of NestJS and RabbitMQ:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NestJS:} Provides a scalable framework for building efficient and fail-safe systems, thanks to its use of modern JavaScript features and its integration with TypeScript.
    \item \textbf{RabbitMQ:} Facilitates secure and flexible cross-service communication, enhances fault tolerance, and manages load effectively, even under high demand.
\end{itemize}

This architectural decision supports our goal of creating a dynamic, reliable, and scalable reward system, prepared to handle increasing loads and complexity as the Aermax platform grows.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{src/assets/chapters/rmq.png}
    \caption{Microservice Communication Example via RabbitMQ in the Reward System}
    \label{fig:microservice_communication_rabbitmq}
\end{figure}

\section{Technology Stack and Framework Selection}

\subsection*{Why We Chose RabbitMQ}
The decision to choose RabbitMQ as our message broker was based on specific needs for our system's communication and architecture:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Decoupling of Services:} RabbitMQ provides independence between services, facilitating a more maintainable and flexible architecture.
    \item \textbf{Asynchronous Communication:} It enables services to communicate without synchronous waits, increasing efficiency.
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} RabbitMQ supports even message distribution, which is essential for scaling services effectively.
    \item \textbf{Reliability and Fault Tolerance:} It ensures message delivery reliability, even when some services are down.
    \item \textbf{Centralized Management:} RabbitMQ offers centralized management of message flows, improving monitoring and control.
    \item \textbf{Ordering and Prioritization:} It manages the order and priority of message handling, which is crucial for process sequencing.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Comparison of Message Brokers}
Below is a comparison of message brokers supported by NestJS, highlighting their main features and common use cases:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Comparison of Message Brokers}
\label{tab:message_brokers_comparison}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{6cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Message Broker} & \textbf{Main Features} & \textbf{Use Case} \\
\hline
Kafka & High throughput, scalability, fault tolerance, and durable storage & Event streaming, log aggregation \\
\hline
MQTT & Lightweight, low bandwidth requirement, designed for IoT devices & IoT, real-time messaging \\
\hline
RabbitMQ & Flexible routing, reliable messaging, multiple protocol support & Complex routing, service decoupling \\
\hline
Redis & In-memory data structure, high performance, supports pub/sub & Caching, real-time analytics \\
\hline
NATS & At-most-once delivery, lightweight, supports queuing & Microservices communication, IoT \\
\hline
gRPC & High-performance RPC, supports bi-directional streaming & Inter-service communication, APIs \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Our selection of RabbitMQ aligns with our system's need for a robust, reliable, and flexible communication backbone.

\section{Message Broker Operation}

\subsection*{How Does a Message Broker Work?}
A message broker like RabbitMQ plays a critical role in modern software architectures by managing communications between different parts of a system. It acts as a middleman that allows services to send and receive messages without knowing the complexities of each other’s design, location, or technology.

\paragraph*{Example: PDF Creation Process}
Consider a PDF creation process in a web application, which is a typical use case for a message broker. Here’s how it operates:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A user initiates a PDF creation request from the website application interface.
    \item The application, acting as the \textbf{Producer}, publishes a message to the RabbitMQ \textbf{Exchange}. This message contains the user’s information and the request details.
    \item RabbitMQ routes the message to the appropriate \textbf{Queue} based on the message's content and the queue's binding rules.
    \item The \textbf{Consumer}, which could be a PDF Creator Worker, listens to the queue, consumes the message, and processes the PDF creation.
\end{enumerate}

This process showcases how RabbitMQ facilitates asynchronous communication, ensuring the application’s responsiveness and reliability. The Producer is decoupled from the Consumer, allowing for independent scaling and maintenance.

\end{figure}

The diagram (Figure \ref{fig:message_broker_workflow}) visualizes this workflow, clarifying the roles of Producers, Exchanges, Queues, and Consumers within the RabbitMQ ecosystem.

\section{NestJS as the Development Framework}

NestJS was selected for its:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Strong support for TypeScript, enhancing code reliability.
    \item Modular architecture, which simplifies scalability and maintenance.
    \item Built-in support for microservices and integration with RabbitMQ.
    \item Dependency injection system, promoting code modularity and reusability.
    \item Growing community and rich ecosystem, providing extensive resources.
    \item Similarity to Angular, offering an easier learning curve for developers.
\end{itemize}

These attributes of NestJS align well with our system’s goals for robust and maintainable microservice development.
