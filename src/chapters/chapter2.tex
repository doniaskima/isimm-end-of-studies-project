In this chapter, we are going to analyze the various specifications and requirements of the whole Aermax project.
We will also describe the product's main features.
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{2}
\section{Overview of the Project}
The Aermax project is a comprehensive initiative aimed at developing a robust and scalable system through the integration of existing and newly developed microservices. This section provides an in-depth look at the architecture and key stakeholders involved in the project.

\subsection{Aermax Architecture}

The following table provides a comprehensive overview of all the application's microservices, detailing their functionalities and scalability.

\textbf{Table 9: All the Applicationâ€™s Microservices}
\begin{longtable}{|p{3cm}|p{7cm}|p{2cm}|}
    \hline

\end{longtable}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Existing Microservices}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Operation Service}: Manages operations and interacts with the Operation Database .
        \item \textbf{User Service}: Handles user-related functionalities and interfaces with the User Database.
        \item \textbf{Keycloak Service}: Provides authentication and authorization services, connected to the Keycloak Database.
    \end{itemize}
    Our contributions to these existing microservices include adding new features, enhancements, and bug fixes.
    \item \textbf{New Microservices}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Reward Service}: Manages reward-related processes and connects to the Reward Database. This service was developed from scratch.
        \item \textbf{Config Service}: A centralized microservice that interacts with all other microservices to provide configuration settings for the reward system. This service was also developed from scratch.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This architecture supports modularity, scalability, and efficient management, ensuring consistent configurations and secure authentication through Keycloak. The diagram below (Figure \ref{fig:aermax-architecture}) illustrates the integration of existing and newly developed microservices within a unified virtual network environment.

\section{Functional Requirements}
Functional requirements define the specific behaviors and functionalities that the system must possess to meet user needs. This section focuses on the key functional requirements for our project, particularly the reward system and other essential functionalities.

\subsection{Feature Enhancement}

This section details the latest upgrades and additions made to our system. These enhancements aim to improve functionality, usability, and overall user satisfaction. Key features introduced are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Equipment List:} Implement a dynamic list of equipment that updates in real-time based on user selections and other criteria.
    \item \textbf{Bug Fixes:} Identify and fix several bugs in the existing functionalities to ensure a smooth user experience.
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Packet View:} Enhance the packet view by adding new functionalities and improving existing features.
    \item \textbf{Project Status Overhaul:} Overhaul the project status feature, including data migration to support the new structure.
    \item \textbf{Role System Overhaul:} Overhaul the role system to provide more granular control and better user management.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reward System}
As mentioned in Chapter 1, Section I.5.3, we provided an overview of the reward system designed to enhance user engagement and motivation. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the specifics of the reward system, which is fundamentally based on Experience Points (XP), Tokens, and Levels/Ranks.

The image below illustrates the core components of our reward system. On the left side, the climber symbolizes user progression through the ranks, carrying a sack of tokens that represents the accumulated rewards. On the right, the various rank logos are displayed, indicating the different levels users can achieve as they gain XP and move up in the hierarchy.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{src/assets/images/AermaxClimberPng.png}
    \caption{User Progression}
    \label{fig:user_progression}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Tokens:} Tokens are a form of currency earned through specific activities and can be redeemed for rewards.

\textbf{XP (Experience Points):} XP is earned by users as they complete tasks and participate in activities, reflecting their progress and engagement.

To support this system, comprehensive algorithms must be developed to calculate rewards and progress behind the scenes. To ensure the effectiveness and accuracy of these algorithms, a simulator was used to visualize and clarify the reward system before actual development began. Each rank in the system has multiple levels, and progressing through these levels requires accumulating a specific amount of XP (Experience Points). This approach leverages gamification principles to keep users engaged and motivated by offering continuous challenges and rewards (see Figure \ref{fig:reward_system_simulator}).

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{src/assets/images/simulator.png}
    \caption{Reward System simulator}
    \label{fig:reward_system_simulator}
\end{figure}

This simulator helps in understanding how users will interact with the reward system, ensuring that the designed algorithms for XP and level progression are effective and engaging.
 

\section{Technical Requirements}
Technical requirements specify the underlying technical aspects and constraints necessary for the system to function correctly. This section outlines the technical requirements that support the functional requirements.

\subsection{Data Management}
Proper data management is essential for the application's integrity and reliability. The system must provide the following technical functionalities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Database Integration:} The application should interact with multiple databases, such as 'reward-service-db' and 'config-service-db,' to store and retrieve data efficiently.
    \item \textbf{Data Synchronization:} Ensure data consistency and synchronization across different services and databases. Handle operations that span multiple microservices.
    \item \textbf{Data Security:} Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive user data, including encryption, access control, and regular security audits.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Integration}
Seamless integration with various external and internal systems is crucial for the application's operation. Key technical integration functionalities include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RabbitMQ Configuration:} Retrieve and manage RabbitMQ configurations from the config service for different microservices. Ensure reliable message queuing and processing.
    \item \textbf{Health Checks:} Implement health checks for various microservices to monitor their status and ensure they are operating correctly.
    \item \textbf{Deployment Pipeline:} Set up a deployment pipeline for staging and production environments, including automated testing, deployment, and monitoring of the reward system.
\end{itemize}

% --------------- Non-functional Requirements --------------- %

\section{Non-functional Requirements}
Non-functional requirements describe any specification that does not add direct business value but is nonetheless crucial for the good operation of developed software.
For Aermax, what we should focus on is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Reliability and Availability:} The software should be available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week.
	\item \textbf{Security:} Clients should be able to safely log in to the dashboard with a strong authentication system.
	\item \textbf{Scalability:} This is the main reason we're using new microservices.
	\item \textbf{Documentation:} We should always document each and every step we make extensively so that new developers can onboard on the project in a fast and efficient way, which further emphasizes reliability.
\end{itemize}

\section{Technologies}
A project can always look simple from the outside, however if we dive deeply into how most software is made, we can see that it's not that simple of a process.
Therefore, this part will list all of the technologies that we've used and also some of the major technical difficulties we've encountered during the realization of our project.
