% Thanking the team
We would like to take a moment to thank all of those involved in finalizing
this work, whether directly or indirectly.
Our profound gratitude goes to the entire Incedo Services GmbH team
for their warm welcome, invaluable support and for accompanying us throughout this wonderful journey. Special thanks to our company supervisor and
product owner Mr. Manuel Schulze who has been very involved with us
almost daily throughout the long period of the internship, his trust in us
has truly allowed us to come very far during this project. We also appreciate Wael Jaber for initially showing us the ropes and for his continuous
guidance. Our deepest gratefulness also goes to Mr. Robert K¨onitz and
Mr. Tobias Schulze for their huge efforts in contributing to our weekly
mentoring sessions amongst other things, their input has truly been a huge
source of knowledge for both of us and will be forevermore. We would also
like to thank both of Mrs. Mai Ly Moll and Mrs. Xenia Harter for
their efforts in business development and for organizing the delightful team
events that we gladly had the occasion to participate in, as well as for their
almost daily engagements that don’t fall short from our supervisor’s. We also
extend our thanks to the rest of the Incedo team Mr. Joachim Liedtke,
Mr. Mohamed Elloumi and Mr. Gabor Kluge.
We also wish to acknowledge the great support of our university supervisor
Mrs. Mahassen Khemiri for her assistance, availability and valuable
spot-on advice. Her faith in us has truly allowed us to keep working on
this project stress-free while confident this report will turn out better than
initially intended.
