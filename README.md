# Final Year Project - Template

This is a starter TeX template with a [development container](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/introduction-to-dev-containers) that can be run directly inside Docker.

That way, you don't have to deal with the dependency hell of configuring and compiling TeX, nor use third party tools that make you leave your editor.

## Getting Started

Assuming you're using VSCode or codespaces

1. You need to get the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

2. Show the command pallete (default shortcut is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and run
   > Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...

Depending on your internet speed, the build will take some minutes...

3. After the dev container is opened, you can know do a build and open the compiled [out/main.pdf](out/main.pdf) to the side. You can do that in a number of ways, the easiest is by doing a `Save`. Here's a picture example.
